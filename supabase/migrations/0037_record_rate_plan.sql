-- Recording which rate plan a stay was sold on.
--
-- create_booking() has always taken p_rate_plan_id, used it to look up each
-- night's price, and then thrown it away. Nothing on bookings, booking_rooms
-- or booking_room_nights says which plan a stay was sold on, so "this guest is
-- on Bed & Breakfast" has never been answerable after the fact.
--
-- That blocks the Meal report, which has to know what a rate includes before
-- it can count a cover. It is also just missing information: the booking
-- screen cannot tell a receptionist which rate the guest is on.
--
-- Nullable, and deliberately not backfilled. Every booking taken before this
-- has no plan recorded and never will — the value was not captured, so there
-- is nothing to reconstruct it from. A guess would be worse than a null,
-- because a null reads as "we do not know" and a guess reads as fact.
--
-- On booking_rooms rather than bookings, because two rooms on one booking can
-- be sold on different terms. p_rate_plan_id is booking-level today, so every
-- line gets the same value; putting the column on the line means that can
-- change later without moving it.
--
-- The plan is recorded even when the line is hand-priced. What the hotel did
-- with the price is a separate question from which rate the stay was taken on,
-- and recording it loses nothing while not recording it loses it for good.
